== Description ==

Enhance your website's user experience and seo ranking by lazy loading images.

### What is lazy loading?

*«Lazy loading is a technique that defers loading of non-critical resources at page load time. Instead, these non-critical resources are loaded at the moment of need.»*
- Jeremy Wagner, Google Developer

In other words:
Lazy loading images makes them being loaded asynchronously which makes it possible to load them conditionally (e.g. when they are within the visitors's viewport). In doing so, you will prevent your visitors from downloading images they would never see anyway.

### What are the advantages?

The main advantages for your visitors are:

#### 1. Reduced page load time

Having to initially load less resources, naturally reduces the loading duration. This will be more noticeable the more images you have on your website and may have a critical impact on your visitors's experience as well as your SEO ranking.

#### 2. Smaller page size

It's possible that your visitors will not scroll down to the very bottom of the page and therefore not load all images. Having to load a few images less might not be relevant on unlimited connections. For visitors browsing your website on limited plans however, you'll prevent them from wasting their data allowances. Again, this is a factor influencing your SEO ranking.

### Browser support
